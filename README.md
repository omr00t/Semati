Semati -- Just another project I was asked to do.


This project helps 9-12 grade students know their environments based on John Holland theory.
John Holland theory is utilized by the Ministry Of Education in Oman to help students know their personalities/environments.

The goal of this project is to show you the questions from the book(produced by MOE) and to calculate the answers so that students
do not have to go through the manual process of calculating their answers for the questions.

This project is a live on this URL: `semati.net`
